Code found on this branch encompasses two bonus exercises I've done:
- [x] Counter – [[code can be found here]](https://github.com/matijakljajic/oxo-pharo/tree/extra/src/MyCounter)
- [x] TinyBlog – [[code can be found here]](https://github.com/matijakljajic/oxo-pharo/tree/extra/src/MyTinyBlog)

Both of these were done while I was going through the [Pharo MOOC](https://mooc.pharo.org/).

My MOOC proof of completion can be found [here](https://github.com/matijakljajic/oxo-pharo/blob/extra/2024-08-01_pharo-mooc-badge.pdf).
