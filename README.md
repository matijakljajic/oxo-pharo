Code found on this branch encompasses two bonus exercises I've done:
- [x] Counter
- [x] TinyBlog

Both of these were done while I was going through the [Pharo MOOC](https://mooc.pharo.org/).

My MOOC proof of completion can be found [here](https://github.com/matijakljajic/semb-pharo/blob/extra/2024-08-01_pharo-mooc-badge.pdf).
